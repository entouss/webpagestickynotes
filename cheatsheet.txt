# Basic writing and formatting syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose with simple syntax.

---
## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

`## The second heading`
`#### The fourth largest heading`
`###### The smallest heading`

## The second heading
#### The fourth largest heading
###### The smallest heading

Alternatively, add `===` or `---` after your heading text instead of `#` or `##` respectively.

`Heading 1`
`===`

Heading 1
===

`Heading 2`
`---`

Heading 2

---
## Table of content

To add a dynamic table of content, add the following to the top of the note:

`<!--TOC-->`

This will dynamically retrieve the headings and create links for them like those found on top of this cheatsheet.
(This is not a markdown syntax but a feature of WebPageStickyNotes.com)

---
## Styling Text
You can indicate emphasis with **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~ text.

|Style|Syntax|Example|Output|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bold|`** **` or `__ __`|`**This is bold text**`|**This is bold text**|
|Italic|`* *` or `_ _`|`*This text is italicized*`|*This text is italicized*|
|Strikethrough|`~~ ~~`|`~~This was mistaken text~~`|~~This was mistaken text~~|
|Bold and italic|`** **` and `_ _`|`**This text is _extremely_ important**`|**This text is _extremely_ important**|

---
## Quoting text
You can quote text with a `>` and nest quotes with `>>`

`In the words of Abraham Lincoln:`
`> Pardon my `
`>> french`

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
> Pardon my
>> french

---
## Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

``Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.``

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.


To write a backtick inside inline code, wrap the inline code with double backticks instead.

````Use git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.  ``\``

``Use git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.  ``


To write a block of code, wrap the code with triple backticks.

\```
var code = 'test';
alert(code);
\```

```
var code = 'test';
alert(code);
```

## Links

`[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)`

`[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")`

`[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]`

`[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)`

`[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]`

`Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].`

`URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.`
`http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>.`

`Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.`

`[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org`
`[1]: http://slashdot.org`
`[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com`

## Anchor Links or Links within a page
(similar to the links at the top of the document)

Add the following where you want the anchor to be:
`<a id="anchor-name"></a>`

Create a link pointing to this anchor:
`[Link Text](#anchor-name)`

---
## Links with (parenthesis)

Use Reference links, instead of standard markdown links.:
`[NotARealLink][1]`
`[1]: http://notareallink/link(1).html`
[NotARealLink][1]
[1]: http://notareallink/link(1).html

Use html inline links.:
`<a href="http://notareallink/link(1).html">NotARealLink</a>`
<a href="http://notareallink/link(1).html">NotARealLink</a>

## Lists
You can make a list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-` or `*`.

`- George Washington`
`- John Adams`
`- Thomas Jefferson`

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

`1.  James Madison`
`2. James Monroe`
`3. John Quincy Adams`

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

You can create nested lists by indenting lines by two spaces.

`1. Make my changes`
&nbsp;&nbsp;`1. Fix bug`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`2. Improve formatting`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`* Make the headings bigger`
&nbsp;&nbsp;`2. Push my commits to GitHub`
&nbsp;&nbsp;`3. Open a pull request`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`* Describe my changes`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`* Mention all the members of my team`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`* Ask for feedback`

1. Make my changes
  1. Fix bug
  2. Improve formatting
    * Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
  * Describe my changes
  * Mention all the members of my team
    * Ask for feedback

---
## Paragraphs and line breaks

You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

For more than one line break, use `<br/>`

`More than one <br/><br/><br/> line break`

More than one <br/><br/><br/> line break

---
## Spaces

Markdown will ignore multiple spaces. You can force spaces with the `&nbsp;` notation.

`Multiple &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spaces`

Multiple &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spaces

---
## Centering text

You can center text using some of the following:

`<p align="center">Centered Text</p>`
`<center>Centered Text 2</center>`

<p align="center">Centered Text</p>
<center>Centered Text 2</center>

---
## Horizontal Lines

You can create horizontal lines as above and below with `---`, `- - -`, `___`, `_ _ _`, `***` or `* * *`.

---
## Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character

`Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*`

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*

---
## Comments only visible in edit mode

`[//]: # (This comment will only be visible in edit mode)`

---
# Organizing information with tables

You can build tables to organize information.

---
## Creating a table

You can create tables with pipes `|` and hyphens `-`. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column.

<pre>
| First Header | Second Header |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
</pre>

| First Header | Second Header |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

The pipes on either end of the table are optional.

Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.

<pre>
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
</pre>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |

---
## Formatting content within your table

You can use formatting such as links, inline code blocks, and text styling within your table.

<pre>
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |
</pre>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

<br/>
You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons : to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.

<pre>
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
</pre>

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

<br/>
To include a pipe `|` as content within your cell, use a `\` before the pipe:

<pre>
| Name     | Character |
| ---      | ---       |
| Backtick | `         |
| Pipe     | \|        |
</pre>

| Name     | Character |
| ---      | ---       |
| Backtick | `         |
| Pipe     | \|        |
