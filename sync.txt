## Sync your notes today!

### First, a note from your developer
The ability to synchronize notes has been the most requested feature for WebPageStickyNotes.com.

- Unfortunately, Chrome only allows 100KB of sync space on their servers, which is very restrictive for all your notes.
- Chrome extensions **don't** allow access to your files and folders.
- Chrome applications **do** allow access to your files and folders.
- Chrome extensions can communicate with Chrome applications.
- Therefore, WebPageStickyNotes.com extension can store your notes on a file via newly implemented WebPageStickyNotes.com/Sync application.
- By saving your notes in your "sync" folder of choice (i.e. <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box.com</a>, <a href="https://onedrive.live.com">OneDrive</a>, etc...), your notes can be synced across devices!

### Warning
After implementing this feature and publishing the WebPageStickyNotes.com/Sync application to the Chrome web store, I found out Chrome was phasing out its applications over the coming years and disabled Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and Linux on its web store. Chrome apps will also stop working in early 2018. (more info <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html">here</a>).

Instead of throwing away all this effort, I decided to keep this functionality for those of you who really need it.
(One can only hope that one day a better way to synchronize notes can be implemented or that support for applications will be extended.)

Instead of hosting WebPageStickyNotes.com/Sync on Chrome web store, it is embedded with the extension itself and can be downloaded and installed right here and now, but not before jumping through a couple of hoops below. (Chrome doesn't make it easy to download applications/extensions outside of its store.)

Finally, some of you mentioned other extensions with sync functionality. Many of those I've researched rely on Gmail/Google Drive API in a way which was not meant to be used.
They are facing connectivity issues, being logged out,  and are hitting quotas (i.e. "20 consecutive gmail requests" messages). Some users are rightly concerned that their Gmail account could be disabled because of this. There is a reason why Chrome only allows 100KB of sync space and limited read/writes per minute.

Without further ado...

### Install WebPageStickyNotes.com/Sync (beta)
1- Right Click <a href="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/WebPageStickyNotesSync.crx">Download</a> & Open link in new tab...
(This will save a file called `WebPageStickyNotesSync.crx`in a download bar at the bottom of this page, but you have to click the Continue button first)
2- In a new tab, type the following in your address bar `chrome://extensions/` and click Enter
(This will open the extension page)
3- Drag `WebPageStickyNotesSync.crx` from the download bar to the extension page to install the application

Once installed, when <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/cloud_off.svg"/> is clicked the first time (reload current page first), a window will popup for you to select a folder where your notes will be stored.
Once the folder is selected, any new notes or modified notes will change the icon to <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/cloud.svg"/> to signal the note is stored in the selected folder.
All previous notes can be stored in the selected file by clicking <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/layers.svg"/>, selecting all notes, and clicking <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/cloud.svg"/> at the top right of the popup.
