## Customize Shortcuts
In prior versions, shortcuts were hard coded and couldn't be customized. Those shortcuts won't work until they are customized per below.

Type the following in your address bar `chrome://extensions/configureCommands`
or click the Chrome menu > More tools > Extensions > Keyboard shortcuts at the bottom of the page.

Some suggested shortcuts:

| Command | Shortcut |
|---|---|
|`Add note` | `Ctrl+Shift+N`|
|`Go to Noteboard` | `Ctrl+Shift+B`|
|`Undo` | `Ctrl+Shift+Z`|
|`Redo` | `Ctrl+Shift+Y`|
|`Copy note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+C`|
|`Cut note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+X`|
|`Paste copied note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+V`|
|`Select all notes` | `Ctrl+Shift+A`|
|`Delete note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+Del`|
|`Take a snapshot of note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+S`|
|`Zoom in note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+I`|
|`Zoom out note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+O`|
|`Zoom note(s) to 100%` | `Ctrl+Shift+U`|
|`Auto fit note(s)` | `Ctrl+Shift+F`|

## Paste formatted VS plain text
When pasting text from the web to a note, by default the formatting will be kept. To paste as plain text, right click the mouse while editing the note and select "Paste as plain text"

---
## Take snapshots
1. Double click <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/camera.svg"> until the note becomes transparent with a border
2. Resize note around area to capture in snapshot
3. Click <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/camera.svg"> to take snapshot

## Persist note across multiple pages
1. Click <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/circle.svg">
<img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/tips/1.png"/>
The note will show on any page matching the selected criteria.
In this example, the note will show on https://www.google.com/ but also on https://www.google.com/?page=1 but not on
https://www.google.com/blank.html since the path name here is `/blank.html` instead of `/`. 
In the example above, `?page=1` is a query string.

## Keep note fixed while scrolling page
1. Click <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/position.svg">
<img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/tips/2.png"/>
2. Select either Top/Right/Bottom/Left
3. Click OK

## Create dynamic table of content
By adding the following text  `<!--TOC-->` in the note, any header will be considered for the table of content dynamically, like the one at the top of this note

---
## Preview note dynamically
Click <img src="chrome-extension://{@@extension_id}/images/right_arrow.svg"/> when editing a note

## Note board
Use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/blank.html\">http://www.google.com/blank.html</a> as a note board. <br/> Use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/blank.html\">http://www.google.com/blank.html?BoardNameHere</a> for different boards.
